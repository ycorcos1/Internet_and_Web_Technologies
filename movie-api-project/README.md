# Movie Helper app
## Helps users pick a movie to watch if they need help finding movies. The user can enter a genre, year and/or actor associated with the movie, search for a movie that has specific keywords, simply search for the top trending movies of the day or week, or look at the top movies of all time based on rating.
### This project interacts with a third party API, TheMovieDB API
